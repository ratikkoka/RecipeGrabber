"This makes a huge meal-sized tray of nachos with lots of good stuff! You can adjust ingredient 
quantities to suit your preference. Serve with extra chips if required. Great for game day." 
Ingredients 
1 pound ground beef 1 cup salsa 
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix 1 cup sour cream, or more to taste 
3/4 cup water 1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained 
1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla and chopped 
chips 4 green onions, diced 
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or 1 (4 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, 
more to taste drained 
1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans 
Directions 
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no 
longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and water and 
simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a 
baking sheet with aluminum foil. 
Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with 
refried beans and ground beef mixture. 
Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 
to 5 minutes. 
Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.
