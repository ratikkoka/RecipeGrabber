"Tall and fluffy. These pancakes are just right. Topped with strawberries and whipped cream, 
they are impossible to resist." 
Ingredients 
3/4 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
2 tablespoons white vinegar 1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 cup all-purpose flour 1 egg 
2 tablespoons white sugar 2 tablespoons butter, melted 
1 teaspoon baking powder cooking spray 
Directions 
Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour". 
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk 
egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and 
whisk until lumps are gone. 
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of 
batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, 
and cook until browned on the other side.
