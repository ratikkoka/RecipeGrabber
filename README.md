# RecipeGrabber
This project asks the user for a dish. The program proceeds to grab the most relevant recipe from allrecipes.com.
It reads and converts all the ingredients to a DataTable which is later iterated over to search and add those
ingredients to the cart on instacart.com.

#Pre-requisites
* The system must be a Windows PC
* The user must have the UIPath Robot set up
*  An Instacart account
